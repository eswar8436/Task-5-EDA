#  Task 5 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

##  Objective:
To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The aim is to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies in the dataset.

##  Tools & Libraries Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab 

##  Dataset:
[Titanic Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)

##  Key Analyses Performed:
- Univariate Analysis (e.g., Age, Fare, Pclass)
- Bivariate Analysis (e.g., Survival by Sex and Class)
- Correlation Matrix & Heatmap
- Pairplot for multivariate visualization
- Missing value handling
- Summary of key insights

##  How to Run:
1. Download the `train.csv` file from Kaggle.
2. Place it in the same directory as the notebook.
3. Open `Task5_EDA_Titanic.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run all cells sequentially to see analysis and results.

##  Deliverables:
- `Task5_EDA_Titanic.ipynb` – Complete code and visuals
- `README.md` – This file
